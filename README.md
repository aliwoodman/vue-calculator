# vue-calculator

## Description

A simple distance/speed/time calculator. No need to specify which value you're trying to calculate - it looks at the last two inputs and automatically calculates the value for the third, minimising clicks ðŸ¥³

It's a PWA so can be added to homescreen and works offline: http://vue-pace-calculator.web.app/
